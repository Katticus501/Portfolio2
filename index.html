      World of Warcraft (WoW)


      <a href= "https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">World of Warcraft</a>:
     is an immersive online game played on the PC. This is a fantasy game where you can play one of two factions!
      From elves to humans, there are so many races to choose from!(I could write more, but I'm too lazy)

<p>  However, races cannot play all the classes. For example only elves can play demon hunters. </p>

<div>
  <strong> Personal character:</strong>
I play a lot of different races and classes, but my favorite is a night elf druid.
A druid is someone who can manipulate nature. For each class there are three different specializations.
In this case, a druid can either be restoration (healer, that can turn into a tree),
caster (turn into a chicken and manipulate stars?),
Guardian (turn into a fricken bear and kill many things without dieing, but without dealing a ton of damage),
or feral (turn into a cat and claw things).
My character is a feral druid, which means she can turn into a cat and use
cat powers to kill enemies.

<h2>World</h2>
The world in WoW is <strong>GINORMOUS</strong>. With 7 expansions, the world has grown to the point
where it would take you <strong>FOREVER</strong> to finish all the quests and explore all the different
areas and their secrets. Luckily, you don't have to.

<p>
To begin you start off as a level 1 noob of any race or class. Your goal is to get to level 110,
which is currently the highest level. To level, you can do quests or play dungeons with other players,
while doing this you gain new powers, armor, and mounts!

Honestly I don't have enough time to go through all the amazingness that WoW offers, so if you want
to know more just go on their website: <a href= "https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">World of Warcraft</a>:
